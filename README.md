THORBot
=======

An IRC bot under development.

Currently supports a variety of commands, with more modules on the drawing board.


MAGNI
======

In Norse mythology, Magni was one of the two sons of Thor. This Magni, too, is a "son" of Thor.
He lacks many of the defining features of Thor, such as the chatterbot functionality and certain other
API integrations, but focuses on a tailored experience.

- Twisted - http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/TwistedWords
- COBE - https://github.com/pteichman/cobe/wiki
