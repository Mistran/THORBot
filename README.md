Usage
=======

As of the current revision, the bot isn't set up to accept more than a !leave [channel] command. There are certain
commands that will print a message to the console for debugging, but mostly it just logs and leaves.

If you decide to Fork this, or in any way modify it, I only ask for some attribution somewhere in your released files.
